1. All the renders are done using 2 different HDRIs.
The Atrium HDRI that I took using a phone didn't come out that well.
Therefore, I borrowed the Luxo_Jr HDRI given to us during our lectures by Jon Macey.

2. I have also done renders for the Lego structure and the single Lego brick in both the HDRIs.

Thank you.
